Hello, and welcome to Redux Framework!

These are our new guidelines for support. Please read them thoroughly before submitting an issue on our issue tracker (or, if you were directed here, modify your ticket with the required information).

First and most importantly, we need to know if you are a developer using Redux in their project or if you are using a theme/plugin that uses Redux. Redux allows developers to include an options panel in their projects. Consequently, we do not offer support for folks who have purchased a theme or plugin that uses Redux. The responsibility of support for themes and plugins falls upon their author. We realize that some authors have included support links for Redux in their projects when they should not have. We apologize for that confusion and are taking steps to remedy this confusion. Please contact the author for support if you have purchased a theme or plugin that uses Redux. If the author is unavailable to support their work or has discontinued support, please refer to this article: [Support Defined](https://devs.redux.io/guides/basics/support-defined.html).

If you are a developer using Redux Framework in your project, PLEASE check if you are using the latest version of Redux by checking this repository. If you plan to report an issue with any version BUT the latest version, we will ask you to upgrade to the newest code base anyway to see if your problem persists. Please save yourself and us some time by taking this simple step first. Thanks!

We designed our issue tracker to help identify and correct issues within Redux Framework. If you believe you have discovered a problem or something is not working as it should, then submitting a ticket is appropriate. However, if you are looking for a custom solution involving Redux, or require help with original code unrelated to the Redux core itself, then this type of support falls outside the scope we offer. We are not PHP/JavaScript tutors or a version of Stack Overflow or have the time and resources to debug your code.

We handle all support for Redux Framework via our issue tracker. Email support is available only for those who have purchased Premium Support or where we have requested contact via email.

You MUST use Redux in dev mode when submitting an issue to us. If you are not or have circumvented our dev mode protocol, you’re on your own. There could be information in your case that requires dev mode to be active. (Compressed JavaScript, for example. We cannot diagnose issues with compressed JavaScript and why dev mode needs to be enabled).

Because it is sometimes difficult to get all the necessary information for a support issue, we ask that you include a WordPress Site Health Report with your problem. To get this report, please follow these steps: In the WordPress Admin screen, click Tools, select Redux, click Info, and click “Copy site info to clipboard.” Paste the results with your support request. This is *required*. We cannot offer support without one. We appreciate your understanding.

If an error or notice appears on your screen, please cut and paste it into your issue. PLEASE, do not say you ‘received a critical error’ without telling us what the error or notice is.

Sometimes, an issue may be tied to JavaScript. To make this determination, you will need to check the JavaScript console. To do this, ensure your web browser is the topmost window. On your keyboard, press CTRL+SHIFT+I. The JavaScript console will open. If there are notices or errors there, please cut and paste them into your issue. We prefer a cut-and-paste since it will include all pertinent information. Also, Redux dev mode must be enabled so an accurate line number may be reported.

It would also be hugely helpful if you could indicate any steps taken until the issue occurred. We may need to recreate your problem on our end, and having this information would help with that. Simply stating something ‘doesn’t work’ isn’t helpful and tells us nothing. PLEASE, be as specific as possible.
