Hello, and welcome to Redux Framework! We offer free bug reporting for our software. Since this service is free, we prefer to provide support our way. This means we ask you to first read the entire block of text below. Please do not post a few lines of what you think is wrong. Doing so without the required information below will get your ticket closed without a reply. We're sorry we have to enforce this policy now.

PLEASE, BEFORE YOU POST, READ THIS ENTIRE BLOCK OF TEXT!!!  

We require all the information specified below for support. If this text block is ignored or the required data is not provided, your ticket will be automatically closed. NO exceptions. Thank you.

Are you a user reporting a bug with a theme or plugin?
======================================================
Redux allows developers to include an options panel in their projects. Consequently, we do not offer support for folks who have purchased a theme or plugin that uses Redux. The responsibility of support for themes and plugins falls upon their author. We realize that some authors have included support links for Redux in their projects when they should not have. We apologize for that confusion and are taking steps to remedy that situation. 

Please contact the author for support if you have purchased a theme or plugin that uses Redux. If the author is unavailable for help or has discontinued support, please refer to this before posting to our issue tracker: https://devs.redux.io/guides/basics/support-defined.html 

Have a development usage question?
==================================
The issue tracker isn't the best place for usage questions. This format is not well-suited for questions & answers, and questions here don't have as much visibility as they do elsewhere. Before you ask a question, here are some resources to get help first:

- Read the docs: https://devs.redux.io/
- Look for/ask questions on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/redux-framework
- Ask in our community Slack channel: http://slack.redux.io/

Think you found a bug?
======================
Please use the "BUG REPORT" template below. Remember, we are rabid about backward compatibility. Do not submit fixes that break previous ways of doing so, or we will reject them.

Also, we will reject your request unless you provide a Site Health Report. NO exceptions. If you do not include this information, and we close your ticket, please do not ask why. Instructions are listed below.

You MUST use Redux in dev mode when submitting an issue to us. If you are not or have circumvented our dev mode protocol, you are on your own. There could be information in your case that requires dev mode active (Compressed JavaScript, for example. We cannot diagnose issues with compressed JavaScript and why dev mode needs to be enabled).

If an error or notice appears on your screen, please cut and paste it into your issue. PLEASE, do not say you received a critical error' without telling us what the error or notice is. If you do so, the ticket will be closed without a reply.

Before you post, check the JavaScript!
======================================
Sometimes, an issue may be tied to JavaScript. To make this determination, you will need to check the JavaScript console. To do this, ensure your web browser is the topmost window. On your keyboard, press CTRL+SHIFT+I. The JavaScript console will open. If there are notices or errors there, please cut and paste them into your issue. We would prefer a cut-and-paste since it will include all pertinent information. Also, Redux dev mode must be enabled so an accurate line number may be reported.
